# EmoteBot
This bot is coded on a bad way.
 Since I don't feel like adding more commands or features,
 I don't feel like it's worth to create a class for each command.
 I put this on Git only to show people how to gifs are created, not to showcase the code.
 Speaking of the code, the cool stuff is just copied from few places on online and are just combined to the bot by me.
